# Completely Random Design (DCA in french)

# Linear Additive Model for the DCA
Y = µ + αi +Σij

Y : Response variable 

µ : Population mean

Σij : Random error

αi : Treatment effect

# Diagram of ANOVA for a completely random design

# a) Diagram title
Sources of variation (SV)	Degree of freedom (DF)	Sum of Square (SC)	Least of Square (MS) Fisher (F)

# b) Diagram first line after title
Treatment :  t-1  (ΣT2 / r) - FC	 SC / (t-1)	   MS treat / MS error

# c) Second line after title
Error : t(r-1)	   Difference	   SC / t(r-1)

# d) Last line for the diagram 
Sum (T) :  tr-1	  Σx2 - FC


# We are very delighted and proud to use data from FAMV, a big thanks to our teacher : Predner DUVIVIER, PHD
